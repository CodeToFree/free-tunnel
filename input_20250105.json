This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role\n * members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some\n * applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see\n * {AccessControlEnumerable}.\n *\n * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed\n * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by\n * using `public constant` hash digests:\n *\n * ```solidity\n * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\");\n * ```\n *\n * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a\n * function call, use {hasRole}:\n *\n * ```solidity\n * function foo() public {\n *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));\n *     ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and\n * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only\n * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\n *\n * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\n * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\n * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\n * {_setRoleAdmin}.\n *\n * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n * grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure\n * accounts that have been granted it. We recommend using {AccessControlDefaultAdminRules}\n * to enforce additional security measures for this role.\n */\nabstract contract AccessControlUpgradeable is Initializable, ContextUpgradeable, IAccessControl, ERC165Upgradeable {\n    struct RoleData {\n        mapping(address account => bool) hasRole;\n        bytes32 adminRole;\n    }\n\n    bytes32 public constant DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE = 0x00;\n\n\n    /// @custom:storage-location erc7201:openzeppelin.storage.AccessControl\n    struct AccessControlStorage {\n        mapping(bytes32 role => RoleData) _roles;\n    }\n\n    // keccak256(abi.encode(uint256(keccak256(\"openzeppelin.storage.AccessControl\")) - 1)) & ~bytes32(uint256(0xff))\n    bytes32 private constant AccessControlStorageLocation = 0x02dd7bc7dec4dceedda775e58dd541e08a116c6c53815c0bd028192f7b626800;\n\n    function _getAccessControlStorage() private pure returns (AccessControlStorage storage $) {\n        assembly {\n            $.slot := AccessControlStorageLocation\n        }\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Modifier that checks that an account has a specific role.
